#1. What is the first pokemon in our database? Our last one?


#2. Find all pokemon that are GHOST type.


#3. Are there more pokemon with even pokemon numbers who are GRASS type or who are FIRE type?


#4. Try to defeat Charizard. Find a pokemon with special attack (sp_attack) greater than 78 and whose type is water.


#5. Pokemon can no longer have over 100 health (hp). Update any pokemon who has health greater than 100 to have only 99 health (hp).


#5. Make a new pokemon. What attributes are necessary? What attributes do you want to make sure you put in?


#6. Everyone hates Jigglypuff. Remove that pokemon from the database (and existance!). Make sure it's not just removed from Rubyland, but also from Databaseland.
